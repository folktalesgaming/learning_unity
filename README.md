# Learning Unity

<p>
It is a simple game project I am building in order to learn unity.
</p>
<p>
It is a 2d pixel side view platformer game that I am trying to create.

### Some features I am working on

- Different levels
- Health bar display
- Bandit character (enemy) able to attack player
- Main menu, Game over Screens
- Health Potions to refill some health
- Some sort of flying enemy to tackle
